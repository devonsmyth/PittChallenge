Project - Intelligient Assistant for General Health (Wesley Wellness)

Ignoring persistent symptoms, emotions, and feelings is an all-too-common 
phenomenon in our increasingly busy lives. This project is designed to keep
track of these things, and alert users when potentially significant 
patterns are observed.
